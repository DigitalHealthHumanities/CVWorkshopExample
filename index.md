## About Me

I am currently the Digital Health Humanities Program Coordinator at the University of California San Francisco. I run the Advancing Digital Health Humanities Institute, supporting new research in the field from a range of scholars across the United States. I am also a PhD Candidate at Indiana University's Media School. My dissertation <i>The Tuberculosis Specimen: The Dying Body and its Use in the War Against the "Great White Plague" (1882-1926)</i> uses digital humanities methods to ask critical questions about the ethics of doing research in the history of medicine.
